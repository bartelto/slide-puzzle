# Slide Puzzle

*Slide Puzzle* loads any online graphic file and turns it into a classic slide puzzle! Scramble the pieces and then see if you can get them back in order again.

## Instructions

- Enter the URL of an image you'd like to use, and press *Submit*. Non-square images will be cropped automatically to fit the puzzle.
- Now start sliding the pieces around! You can move pieces individually, or slide an entire row or column of pieces. Just click on the piece you would push with your finger on a physical puzzle.
- Once you've thoroughly scrambled the puzzle, try to solve it! Or see if a friend can solve it.
- Depending on the image, this can be pretty challenging, so the pieces are numbered to provide an extra clue.
